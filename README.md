# 🏓 Pong Game

A super simple two-player Pong game built with vanilla HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. No dependencies, no build step — just open `index.html` and play.

## Controls

## Rules

- First to **7 points** wins.
- The ball speeds up slightly with each paddle hit (capped at max speed).
- The angle of the bounce depends on where the ball hits the paddle.
